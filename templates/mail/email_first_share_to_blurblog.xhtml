    <p style="line-height: 20px;">This is a personal website made for you that you can customize. You can also share out links to your blurblog, where friends and followers can reply and re-share your stories.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 20px;">Blurblogs were built so you would have a way to share stories with people who aren't on PyTune and don't want to load the entire reader just to read and comment on your shared stories.</p>
